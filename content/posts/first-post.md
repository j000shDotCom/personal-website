Hello world!

No idea what I am doing, but it looks like things are appearing finally.  This sure has been a productive 1.5 hour flight from SFO to PHX!

I am still learning Hugo and how to create, link, and tag new posts.  I think I am haphazardly getting the hang of it though.  Seems simple enough.  Not sure what the difference is between "+++" and "---" when it comes to post/article headers.  I ultimately want to create my own theme.  The urge to do that was probably with biggest hurdle with using Hugo.


Gotta run!  Will try to update weekly!
